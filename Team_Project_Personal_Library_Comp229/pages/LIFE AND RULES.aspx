        If I asked you to tell me what you’ve learned so far to have the best, happiest, most successful life, what advice would you give me?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the rules (or rules of thumb) you’ve learned in your 20,30,50, 80 years of life?</p>
    <p>
        I’ve been getting a lot of emails on the subject lately, and I’ve struggled to answer the question myself. &nbsp;What really matters in life? What really makes you happy?</p>
    <p>
        So I went back to the basics. &nbsp;I thought a lot about my own life and wrote down the principles I use to guide everything I do. &nbsp;I then wondered – were there any studies on the subject? I was happy to find that there was. &nbsp;So, these aren’t just my rules – these are rules that research also shows can improve your life.</p>
    <p>
        And, perhaps unsurprisingly, it starts with love.</p>
